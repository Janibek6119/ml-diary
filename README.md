Ok, so there is [this course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

Folders `course-{1,2,3}` are related to segments of it.

But before it there was only `enthusiasm`.

And, parallel to both, there was a `junkyard`.

All code written manually unless explicitly stated otherwise. Ok, maybe I forgot sth.

See, each 15-minute video on the course meant about 3+ hours of experimenting in Jupyter notebooks.

Only purpose of this repo is to be a "memoir" of an ML learner.

Have fun.
